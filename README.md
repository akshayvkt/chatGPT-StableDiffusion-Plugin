# chatGPT-StableDiffusion-Plugin
Generate and edit images within chatGPT UI using this plugin

You can now generate and also edit images through natural language prompting through the chatGPT image generation plugin.

This makes API calls Replicate's Stable Diffusion model, so an API key for Replicate is a requirement.

Since chatGPT is context-aware, editing the generated images is much easier.
